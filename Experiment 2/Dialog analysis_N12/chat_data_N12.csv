6,"9caxmijh","yes"
2,"9caxmijh","lets call it shield"
5,"9caxmijh","not really becasue the edges are too pointy. but maybe the broad shape isnt that far off "
8,"9caxmijh","Does it look a bit like a scythe?"
1,"9caxmijh","Fig.3 looks like a pointy shield"
6,"9caxmijh","yes that is my figure 2"
8,"9caxmijh","Oh sorry, you said symmetrical"
6,"9caxmijh","pointy shield sounds good"
5,"9caxmijh","fig 5 "
8,"9caxmijh","That's my figure 5"
1,"9caxmijh","Perfect"
2,"9caxmijh","figure three is symmetrical with spikey bits out to either side and rounded two rounded stalks on top "
8,"9caxmijh","Sounds good"
9,"9caxmijh","so figure 1 for me is an asymmetrical shape where the left side is short and has a small piece extending down, and the right side is much bigger "
2,"9caxmijh","my last partner called it antennae"
5,"9caxmijh","its got 3 triangles"
4,"9caxmijh","my fig 1 looks like two fists coming off a plate"
5,"9caxmijh","yes"
1,"9caxmijh","Fig.4 looks like bug antennae"
2,"9caxmijh","shall we go with antennae?"
6,"9caxmijh","yes my figure 4 is the same, bug antennae sounds good"
4,"9caxmijh","thats my fig 1sure"
8,"9caxmijh","That's my figure 3 as well"
2,"9caxmijh","ok"
1,"9caxmijh","Great"
3,"9caxmijh","mine is fig 4"
9,"9caxmijh","okay cool what should we call it?"
8,"9caxmijh","That works"
6,"9caxmijh","my figure 5 is a small flag pointing to the left"
1,"9caxmijh","Fig.5 looks like a flag"
3,"9caxmijh","thats a tough one"
4,"9caxmijh","my fig 5 is inverted triangles "
2,"9caxmijh","figure 4 - last round my partner called it an angel from the top of the christmas tree. it's not symmetrical"
5,"9caxmijh","maybe 2. to me it looks like the blade of a scythe"
4,"9caxmijh","my fig 4"
5,"9caxmijh","fig 4 is like the antanne of a bug"
1,"9caxmijh","Or blade pointing left"
8,"9caxmijh","Does it look like a shoe if you rotate it clockwise?"
2,"9caxmijh","shall we call 4 angel and 5 apron?"
9,"9caxmijh","like a leaf maybe"
4,"9caxmijh","sure"
