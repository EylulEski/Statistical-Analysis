4,"e4n3narf","okay so we will call it antenna"
9,"e4n3narf","same"
16,"e4n3narf","that is my figure 2"
6,"e4n3narf","same!"
19,"e4n3narf","Fig 2 looks like snail heads. "
15,"e4n3narf","Perfect!"
14,"e4n3narf","Yes that sounds good!"

4,"e4n3narf","shield"
3,"e4n3narf","it seems the figures are in the same position then"
15,"e4n3narf","I named 1 Swans and 2 Beak"
18,"e4n3narf","I can also say that, yes. like antenna"
14,"e4n3narf","My figure 2 looks like a bug's antennae "
5,"e4n3narf","okies"
8,"e4n3narf","we can name them antenna and shield then, agreed ?"
17,"e4n3narf","ok were on the same page."
15,"e4n3narf","Yes, mine are the same"
7,"e4n3narf","Yeah "
7,"e4n3narf","Perfect"

21,"lyrisecf","there are two of them"
23,"lyrisecf","my figure one looks like a bug antenna"
22,"lyrisecf","and 2 looks like antennae"
24,"lyrisecf","So I have two figures"
21,"lyrisecf","like about to touch each other"
7,"lyrisecf","my figure one looks like little bug antenna and my figure two looks like a droopy dragon shield"
23,"lyrisecf","very rounded"
24,"lyrisecf","one looks like a shield to me"
2,"lyrisecf","That's figure 2 for me"

2,"lyrisecf","And that's figure 1 for me"
22,"lyrisecf","aha so 1=2 and 2=1"
1,"lyrisecf","my fig 1 looks like a bug antenna "
13,"lyrisecf","I think my figure 1 is the same. I was going to say dragons head"
22,"lyrisecf","let's call them shield and antennae?"
24,"lyrisecf","and other one obviously looks like an antennae"
21,"lyrisecf","great! calling it antennae"
13,"lyrisecf","but shield works"

20,"lyrisecf","ok, so that's easy! I will enter antennae and shield"
1,"lyrisecf","antenna is good"
23,"lyrisecf","so we call them shield and antenna?"
7,"lyrisecf","just to confirm, shield is spiky"
8,"lyrisecf","yes"
24,"lyrisecf","like pair of bug anntennae"
2,"lyrisecf","Yep, perfect!"

13,"lyrisecf","figure 2 looks like bug antennae to me as well"
24,"lyrisecf","yeahm I was going to say a medieavel shield with dragon head :D"
22,"lyrisecf","right!"
13,"lyrisecf","I will take it!"
7,"lyrisecf","we got this"
22,"lyrisecf","noiceee"
24,"lyrisecf","So I call it shield simply"
24,"lyrisecf","and antennae"
2,"lyrisecf","Placing my bet we see 0 points on the next page"
13,"lyrisecf","yes that works! "
13,"lyrisecf","shield and antennae it is :)"
24,"lyrisecf","cheers, 1: shield, 2:antennae"

4,"lyrisecf","shall we call it 'bug'"
21,"lyrisecf","i wrote bug antennae"
24,"lyrisecf","great,"
1,"lyrisecf","perfect and i called that antenna"
21,"lyrisecf","is that ok"
5,"lyrisecf","i forgot what the next step will be will it ask for my figure 1 name"
2,"lyrisecf","Great!"

8,"lyrisecf","hello"
14,"lyrisecf","Hi!"
20,"lyrisecf","hey!"
22,"lyrisecf","my fig 1 looks like antennae"
5,"lyrisecf","my fig 1 looks like a sheild"
23,"lyrisecf","my first figure looks like a shield with some spikes"
2,"lyrisecf","My fig 1 looks like a pointed shield"
15,"lyrisecf","Hi there!"
9,"lyrisecf","hello"
24,"lyrisecf","So I see two figures!"
8,"lyrisecf","that is my figure 2"
5,"lyrisecf","and 2 antennae"
4,"lyrisecf","yeah same"
22,"lyrisecf","and fig 2 looks like a shield"
20,"lyrisecf","my fig1 looks like a pair of rounded antennae on a slug"
4,"lyrisecf","what shall we call it?"
23,"lyrisecf","and my second figure like antenna from a bug"
21,"lyrisecf","the shield one is like point on top right?"
13,"lyrisecf","figure one looks like bug antennae to me"
8,"lyrisecf","and your figure 2 is my figure 1, like a shield"
24,"lyrisecf","One looks like an antennae to me! Very obvious pair of bug antennae"
21,"lyrisecf","has 4 spikes on top"
2,"lyrisecf","Should I just call it shield?"
20,"lyrisecf","my fig2 looks like a spiky shield"
23,"lyrisecf","they are also 1 shield and 2 antenna?"
5,"lyrisecf","yeah thats it"
9,"lyrisecf","my figure one looks like two swans almost kissing"
4,"lyrisecf","yeah sounds good"
5,"lyrisecf","one big point on the bottom"
21,"lyrisecf","great!"
3,"lyrisecf","thats my figure 2"
21,"lyrisecf","and the other one is antennae"
14,"lyrisecf","Yes! My fig 1 is also the bug antennae"
15,"lyrisecf","With the rounded ends? Yes, I have the same figure one"
5,"lyrisecf","yesss"
2,"lyrisecf","And figure to looks like antennae"
20,"lyrisecf","ah good!"
23,"lyrisecf","great"
22,"lyrisecf","okay so 1=2 and 2=1"
5,"lyrisecf","my fig 1 shield and fig 2 antennae "
13,"lyrisecf","figure two looks like a dragons head with spikey ends around it. Does that sound correct?"
21,"lyrisecf","okay thats the reverse for me"
20,"lyrisecf","so I will enter 1 = antenna, 2 = shield"
5,"lyrisecf","so you the other way round?"
24,"lyrisecf","The other one looks like a shield to me, like the Medieavel age shields "
4,"lyrisecf","yeah same for me"
22,"lyrisecf","is it cool if i call them antennae and shield?"
5,"lyrisecf","okay"
21,"lyrisecf","wrote down the answers!"
4,"lyrisecf","what do you want to call it"
4,"lyrisecf","?"
5,"lyrisecf","where do i write them???"
20,"lyrisecf","hopefully 2 points for us!"
9,"lyrisecf","ok figure 1 name could be swan and figure 2 spikes"
3,"lyrisecf","my figure 1 looks like like a tie "
5,"lyrisecf","i did it wrong last time"
2,"lyrisecf","Just called it antennae"
21,"lyrisecf","I think only one person writes it"
8,"lyrisecf","yes that is correct. my figure 2 is antenna and my figure 1 is shield"
24,"lyrisecf","so 1: antennae 2: shield?"
4,"lyrisecf","ok cool"
21,"lyrisecf","on the last round i didn't write"
24,"lyrisecf","what do you say?"
5,"lyrisecf","ahhh so is that you"
