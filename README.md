Overview
=========================

This repository contains R scripts used to analyse data from a series of experiments.

Experiment 2:
  Investigates how selected seed/target words spread within two types of 12-person networks: a random network and a clustered network
  All other variables were held constant except for network topology.

Experiment 3:
  Extends the analysis to 24-person networks to explore how network topology affects the spread of linguistic behaviour in larger networks.

Experiment 4:
  Examines whether the initial placement of seed speakers (i.e., where the behaviour begins spreading)
  influences how widely the linguistic behaviour propagates.
